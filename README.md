AI-ML Project (Nov, 2022) for Dr K. Ravi Kishore
Abstract: This project deals with the problem of recommendation system using cosine similarity and takes the useful input using open-cv face and gender detect. The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle and contained a list of products from Mytra.com. Details of the product like brand name, description, etc. are then processed by NLP pre-processing nodes in KNIME. This is then fed into TF-IDF to get tag vectors of the products in the list, which will later be used to recommend products to the user. From face data, it gets the gender data of the user and uses the suitable data to recommend. The model then recommends top 5 highest rated products and then lets the user select anyone of the product. The model then, by using cosine similarity tells the user which products to recommend.
